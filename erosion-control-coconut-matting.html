                <p style="margin-top: 75px;"><strong><a href="http://rumahsabut.com/">Erosion control coconut matting</a></strong> - Of course, we have often heard about soil erosion that continues to occur in Indonesia. The line with the soil conditions in The characteristic of soil Indonesia is easy for soil erosion to occur, coupled with the climate and high rainfall. The areas have high rain intensity, such as Sumatra and Java. The types of soil are to slide easily worsen the condition.</p>

                <p>The slow handling of soil erosion makes the ecosystem around the soil erosion even more damaged. Currently, the level of soil damage is almost all over Indonesia. The lack of knowledge of soil cultivation among farmers is one of the primary causes. Therefore, conservative efforts are needed to prevent soil erosion.</p>

                <p>In brief, erosion can also occur due to water and wind. In Indonesia, soil erosion often occurs due to the strong water flow. Soil erosion occurs when nothing vegetation grows on the soil, so water seeps directly into the tree roots. Then how to prevent soil erosion? Here's how to prevent and rehabilitate soil quality.</p>

                <h2>What is the Solution to Prevent Soil Erosion?</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Use Soil-Friendly Agricultural Practices</li>
                        <p>Terrace agriculture adjusts on hilly land. Terraces prevent erosion and facilitate irrigation for crops. In addition, agricultural fields in hilly areas need cover crops to keep soil particles in place. It creates by cultivating crops in the form of intercropping. That is to formulate the two types of crops together in the same field, for example, planting the corn or soybeans between rows of oil palm trees. Agroforestry systems that cultivate the varieties of food crops and forest crops can be an effective solution for farmers. The use of manure can also increase the levels of soil organic matter and strengthen the soil structure to inhibit erosion. In addition, sowing the deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants alternately can improve soil structure and reduce erosion.</p>
                    <li>Providing Incentives for Sustainable Land Management</li>
                        <p>Although the science of sustainable land management is gaining popularity, the socio-economic context often makes it hard to implement. Sustainable land management practices must be financially viable for farmers. Erosion prevention measures cost a median of $500 per hectare, a sizeable investment for a farmer. Governments and banks need to help farmers access financing and set support in implementing erosion prevention measures. This effort that is not only benefits farmers but also the entire community. Prevention costs are much lower than land restoration and rehabilitation costs. It estimate at $1,500â€“$2,000 per hectare. Other sources find that the charge can be as high as $15,221 per hectare.</p>
                    <li>Prevention AND Rehabilitation</li>
                        <p>The key to managing and reducing soil erosion is to rehabilitate damaged soil, prevent further degradation, and include erosion prevention measures as a component of land management policies. In this way, we can prevent hunger and reduce the climate crisis. Erosion control coconut matting is a natural geosynthetic erosion control product that is a flexible, lightweight 3D mat made from high-strength coconut fiber geotextile that serves to protect the slope surface or protect against soil erosion, reduce emissions and encourage infiltration. Erosion protection mats do a great job of protecting the soil surface from being washed away and quickly creating lawns.</p>
                </ol>
                <p>In other words, <a href="https://rumahsabut.com/coir-geotextiles/">erosion control coconut matting</a> stabilized coconut fiber geotextile reduces the possibility of erosion caused by other heavy rains and provides a green layer of vegetation on rivers, riverbanks, pond edges, steep slopes, and grassy marshes. Vegetated erosion control mats not only prevent soil and sediment erosion but also provide excellent filtration and vegetation, ultimately improving soil conditions and slope stability.</p>
